# Sarah's First Website 

My first website using Markdown and GitHub Pages.

## Links (Two hashes is a second level heading)

Here's a clickable link: [Info on Github Docs]([https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/learning-about-github/githubs-plans])

## Images

Images look like links except with an exclamation directly in front

## Reminders

Use a dash space for unordered lists

- Spaces matter

- Spelling matters

- Capitalization matters
